Ideas for improvements:
use more input check and warning in settings dialog
make that somehow clear that the set RSI won't be accurate (depends on refresh rate)
make decimal point configurable (see replace(".", ",") lines)
implement some basic output variable calculation in a post-process script (stimhl)
use a bit more readable variable names (both in name and in output). e.g. bad naming example: stimpr and "PR" in output (can pattern_or_random or someting like that)
might be a good idea to make consitent the output variable: session, epoch, block, trial, how they are calculated, as global serial number or as inner serial number
store both converted user id and the user name without changes
don't continue with a block after a quit, but start from the beginning of the block
measure how much time it takes to run one trial (without RSI and RT) -> can be optimized based on this value
cleanup instructions, accent characters, ':' etc
ET: fixation point, stim_bg
RT: ast block's feedback, RT test (use clock object)

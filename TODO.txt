Ideas for improvements:
use more input check and warning in settings dialog
make that somehow clear that the set RSI won't be accurate (depends on refresh rate)
make decimal point configurable (see replace(".", ",") lines)
store both converted user id and the user name without changes
cleanup instructions, accent characters, ':' etc
RT: last block's feedback, RT test (use clock object)
output_line?
move classes to separate files
add integration tests also for ET experiments
create a separate presentation method for RT and ET version

I. Trial level data
1. Files like: subject_10__trial_log_extended.csv
    Overview:
    These files contains all trial level data of the given sibject. The subject ID is in the file name: subject_X__trial_log_extended, where
    X is the subject ID. One line of this file means one trial.

    Fields:
    - computer_name: Internally used identifier of the computer we used for the experiment. We used only computer, so this field has no actual effect.

    - monitor_width_pixel: Monitor's with in pixel unit (e.g. 1920).

    - monitor_height_pixel: Monitor's height in pixel unit (e.g. 1080).

    - subject_group: We did not have different groups in this experiment, so this field is always empty.

    - subject_number: ID of the subject, which belongs this data file. It should be the same what the file name contains.

    - subject_sex: Sex of the subject. Three possible values: male, female, other.

    - subject_age: Age of the subject (e.g. 22).

    - asrt_type: Type of ASRT task of the given epoch.
      Possible values: noASRT - randomized data, implicit - implicit ASRT, explicit - explicit ASRT (explicit instruction).
      In the first epoch of the experiment we used randomized trials, so there the ASRT type is noASRT, otherwise it's implicit.
      We did not used explicit instructions in this experiment.

    - PCode: The sequence we used to generate the trials according to ASRT design.
      Possible values: noPattern - randomized data, 1234, 1243, 1324, 1342, 1423 or 1432 - sequences of stimulus positons.
      1234 means the stimulus is first displayed at the 1st position, then it is displayed at the 2nd positon after a random trial, etc.

    - session: Number of session. Here, session means one part of data acqusition, which was done at once, without any break. There were two phases
      of this experiment: Learning phase (session 1) and Testing phase (session 2).

    - epoch: Number of the current epoch. A number in [1-8] interval. Learning phase contains the first 5 epochs (1-5 epochs), while testing phase
      contains three additional epochs (6-8 epochs). This epoch number is a global number apply to the whole experiment.

    - block: Number of the block. A number in [1-40] interval. Learning phase contains the first 5 * 5 blocks (1-25 blocks), while testing phase
      contains 3 * 5 additional block (25-40 blocks). This block number is a global number apply to the whole experiment.

    - trial: Number of the trial inside the given block. A number in [1-82] interval. This not a global number, it can be interpreted together
      with the block number.

    - frame_rate: Monitor's refresh rate measured by Psychopy's getActualFrameRate() method. It's a value in ms (millisecond) and it tells how many
      frames were display during one second. It was measured once at the beginning of the experiment.

    - frame_time: Monitor's avarage frame time measured by Psychopy's getMsPerFrame() method. It's a value in ms (millisecond) and it tells how many
      time it takes to display one frame on the screen. It was measured once at the beginning of the experiment.

    - frame_sd: Standard deviation of the monitor's frame time measured by Psychopy's getMsPerFrame() method. It's a value in ms (millisecond)
      and it indicates the deviation in displaying one frame on the screen. It was measured once at the beginning of the experiment.

    - stimulus_color: The color used for displaying stimulus on the screen. It's one of PsychoPy predefined color names. We used "DarkBlue" during
      the whole experiment.

    - trial_type_pr: This field indicates whether the stimulus of the current trial was generated randomly ("random") or it was generated as part of
      of the given sequence ("pattern"). In the first epoch, where all trials were generated randomly, this field is always "random",
      while in other epochs, this field follows the ASRT alternating structure, so "random" and "pattern" values are alternating.

    - triplet_type_hl: It's an attribute of three trials, not only one. The value put in the line of a trial means a property of the last three trials.
      So for the first two trials of all block this field contains a "none" value. Otherwise this field can be "low" or "high". "Low" means
      low frequency triplet and "high" means high frequency triplet. This frequencies should be interpreted according to the given epoch.
      In the learning epochs this frequencies are calculeted according to the learning sequence, while in the interference epoch (epoch 7), this is computed
      based on the interference sequence. It's alway calculated based on the sequence of the given epoch (see PCode field). In the first epoch,
      where there were no sequence, this field has always "none" value.

    - stimulus: The place, where the stimulus was showed in the given trial. It's value in [1-4] interval. 1 - top-left positon, 2 - top-right positon,
      3 - bottom-left position, 4 - bottom-right position.

    - RT (ms): Reaction time in ms measure in the trial. This time measured from the time point, where the stimuls was displayed, until the subject
      had a 100 ms fixation on the given stimulus.

    - last_AOI_before_stimulus: Last AOI where the subject's eye was recorded during the RSI before the next stimulus was disaplayed. We use this
      to calculate anticipation data.

    - repetition: Repetition means thath the last trial and the current trial has the same stimulus (see stimulus field). It's a boolean value.

    - trill: Trill means that the trial before the last trial is the same as the current trial (e.g. 1-3-1, 2-3-2). It's a boolean value. "True"
      means that the current trial is the last trial of a trill.

    - high_low_learning: Triplet type based on the learning sequence. It's similar to triplet_type_hl field, but here we use the learning sequence
      to calculate this in all epochs. The learning sequence is the one we gave the subject in the 2-5 epochs. We have "high" and
      "low" values here similar to triplet_type_hl.

    - has_anticipation: There were anticipatory eye-movement in the given trial, during RSI. If the last_AOI_before_stimulus is different from the
      AOI of the stimulus of the last trial, then we call it an anticipation and then this field contains "True".

    - has_learnt_anticipation: If the recorded anticipatory eye-movements followed the learnt sequence. If has_anticipation field has a "True" value
      and if the last_AOI_before_stimulus follows the sequence, then this value is also "True".

III. Data quality
1. missing_data_ratios.csv / missing_data_ratios.xlsx
    Overview:
    In this output file, we calculated the missing data ratio of all data samples. Missing data during the reaction time experiment can lead to noise
    in reaction times. To control the noise comming from fixation algorithm, we can control the level of data loss.

    Fields:
    - epoch: Identifier of the epoch we calculated the missing data ratio for. This identifier contains a subject
    ID and an epoch number in the following format: subject_X_Y, where X is the subject ID and Y is the epoch number
    (e.g. a number in [1,8] interval).

    - missing_data_ratio: Percentage of missing data inside the given epoch of the given subject. We call missing data when
    the eye-tracker returns with invalid state for both eyes inside sample. We calculate the ratio of these invalid / missing data
    compared to all eye-tracking samples of the epoch.

2. RMS(S2S)_data.csv / RMS(S2S)_data.xlsx
    Overview:
    We calculate eye-tracking precision with root mean square of sample-to-sample distances. We get all successive samples during fixations
    and calculate the distance of these samples, of the eye position they code. We got one fixation at the end of all trials of epochs. This
    is 12 samples. We calculate gaze position distances of all pair of these samples following each other (15 distances) in view angle,
    compute RMS statistic from these distances and finally compute the median value of these RMS values inside every epoch.

    Fields:
    - epoch: Identifier of the epoch we calculated the RMS values for. This identifier contains a subject ID and an epoch number
    in the following format: subject_X_Y, where X is the subject ID and Y is the epoch number (e.g. a number in [1,8] interval).

    - RMS(S2S)_median: Calculated RMS values' median in the given epoch.

3. screen_eye_distance_data.csv / screen_eye_distance_data.xlsx
    Overview:
    The used eye-tracker has a trackbox, where the subject's head should be, so the eye-tracker can record eye-position data precisely.
    The eye-tracker we used allows 50 cm - 90 cm distance from the screen. We checked the actual distance we recorded during the
    experiment an checked for extreme data.

    Fields:
    - epoch: Identifier of the epoch we calculated the RMS values for. This identifier contains a subject ID and an epoch number
    in the following format: subject_X_Y, where X is the subject ID and Y is the epoch number (e.g. a number in [1,8] interval).

    - median_distance_mm: Meadian distance of all samples recorded during the given epoch. These values are in mm unit. The ideal
    distance was 65 cm with the used eye-tracker. Median values close to 50 cm, means that the subject was outside of the offical
    trackbox durind recording.

4. RMS(E2E)_data.csv / RMS(E2E)_data.xlsx
    Overview:
    We calculate eye-tracking precision with root mean square of eye-to-eye distances. We get all samples during fixations and
    calculate the distance of these samples, of the eye position they code. We got one fixation at the end of all trials of epochs. This
    is 12 samples. We calculate eye position distances of all these samples (16 distances) in view angle, compute RMS statistic from these distances
    and finally compute the median value of these RMS values inside every epoch.

    Fields:
    - epoch: Identifier of the epoch we calculated the RMS values for. This identifier contains a subject ID and an epoch number
    in the following format: subject_X_Y, where X is the subject ID and Y is the epoch number (e.g. a number in [1,8] interval).

    - RMS(E2E)_median: Calculated RMS values' median in the given epoch.
